Inspired by a lecturer on the space science leg whilst completing M813

My facination with old mechanical calculating machines made me try this.

As if the world needs another secret cipher machine.

This is work in progress, I take no responsibility 

The aim is as simple as possible, yet easy to understand  

implement double step behaviour for middle wheel, first offset calcuation in 
rotor_wheel.go ,transpose()  probably needs to change as result
